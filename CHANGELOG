Checking in version 1.3.2. Included bug fixes only

*** empty log message ***


Revision 2004/04/15 - updates since version 1.1.1
- Modified algorithm to detect interrupt coalescence
- Algorithm to estimate available bandwidth in presence of interrupt 
  coalescence.

Revision 2003/12/14 - bug fix since version 1.1.0
- Modified README.
- Make new thread detached in pathload receiver. This fixes a bug
  in older version, where receiver would hang after approx 20 fleet as not 
  enough memory was available to create a new thread and receiver would exit
  with a message "Receiver not responding".
- Fixed a bug in sender that would cause sender running in iterative mode to 
  exit with "Broken pipe" if receiver was killed.
- Simplified code to detect interrupt coalescence.
- Several other minor changes in the code

Revision 1.12 2003/04/09 04:31:13  jain
Modified the README


Revision 2003/04/06 05:16:00
Added option to have output in netlogger
format.

Revision 2003/04/04 01:21:22
implemented function to measure minimum sleep
time using select.

Revision 2003/04/03 21:06:57
Estimate gettimeofday() latency on sender since
some freebsd versions have gettimeofdaylatency equal 
to 5 usec.

Revision 2003/04/02 01:42:10
Modified the output mesages on pathload receiver.

Revision 2003/04/01 16:16:12
Added select so that sender doesnot block and
now waits a maximum of 50 sec for a control message
from receiver during a ongoing measurement.
Also reduced the aggregate threshold from .7 -> to .6.

Revision 2003/03/25 19:42:22
get_adr() additionally checks for interrupt coallescence.

Revision 2003/03/23 04:29:40
Modified the command line interface in pathload receiver.

Revision 2003/03/21 01:41:17
Removed bugs.

Revision 2003/03/19 15:27:36
Removed bugs.

Revision  2003/03/18 12:33:07  jain
Thread implementation in place of select.
select introduces additional latency while 
is a issue in gigabit path.

Revision 2003/02/09 04:36:47 jain
Trend detection after each stream
code working in low bandwidth paths.

CHANGELOG : modified CHANGELOG

Revision 1.8  2002/10/31 17:47:27  jain
pathload_rcv_func.c : replaced blocking recvfrom by select.
pathload_snd_func.c : deley FINISH_STREAM by 200 usec.

10/22/02
In eliminate_rcvr_side_CS, changed
<  if ( ( rcvr_time_stamp[i+1] -  rcvr_time_stamp[i]  )  < rcv_latency )
to
>  if ( ( rcvr_time_stamp[i+1] -  rcvr_time_stamp[i]  )  <= (1.2 * rcv_latency) )

08/02/2002 - 1.0.3.2
Added code measure mss on sender and receiver. Also tried some testing on gigabit machines. Geting 100% losses.Dont know why ?
08/29/2002 - 1.0.3.3
new modifications : first time from gatech
08/29/2002 - 1.0.3.3
new modifications : first time from gatech

09/12/2002 
Changed min packet size to 300 bytes.
Changed min time interval to 150 usec.

07/25/02
Added code in pathload_snd_func to send
stream at lower rates ( < 1..17 mbps ).

07/25/02
Made grey_bw_resolution 5% of ADR.
Earlier it was 1.5 MBPS.
what if ADR could not be measures ?
